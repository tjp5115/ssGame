Developed in: Visual Studio 2013

The Libraries folder has all the necessary files to be linked into VS.

This project was created mainly to test out some of the new vector math I have been researching / taking in college


directory layout:
  libraries -> SDL_2 libraries used
  ssGame    -> the visual studio folder used for the project.
